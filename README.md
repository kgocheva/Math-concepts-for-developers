# Homework repository for the Math Concepts for Developers course
This is another repository of homework stuff - this time from the basic course I took in order to fill some gaps in my statistics knowledge. 
Math Concepts for Developers is the first course of a series offered by the Bulgarian SoftUni, also featuring data sience, machine learning and deep learning. Its topics include the topics of High School maths, Basic and Linear alebra, Calculus, Probability and combinatorics, Statistics, and Hypothesis testing. 
The entire seris of courses strikes a good balance between explaining the rationale, building up intuitive understanding and specific exercises - communicated excellently by the outstanding tutor Yordan Darakchiev.
